# sentiment-analysis
sentiment analysis using python and machine learning techniques
PYTHON 3.4

There are two implementations. 
First implementation which is based on research paper has Porter algorithm for stemming and compares the result between svm and naive bayes.. It's a 10 fold cross validation. Right now, we have to manually provide the test and training file each time but will update the code shortly to make it so that it runs the code automatically on whole dataset and shows the result at last. 

Second implementation (sentiment analysis.py) simply compares the results between 3 algorithms i.e. SVM, Naive Bays and Maximum entropy
